          <p>We currently have one funded project and several potential projects
          that are out for consultation. We will be starting a survey to get
          some feedback on these projects. The survey will be sent by post and
          available online in early April. However, please feel free to contact
          us at any time with any feedback relating to any or all of these
          projects. We also welcome anyone to submit an idea for a project they
          would like to see realised - <a href="mailto:contact@westdidscommunity.co.uk">contact@westdidscommunity.co.uk</a>.</p>

          <p>We have secured funding for a coffee afternoon for over 50s in
          Christ church hall. It will take place on alternate Tuesday’s from
          1-4pm. This was the only slot available. We aim to start the sessions
          in mid June and would like to get ideas from the community about what
          they would like to do with these sessions. We will provide
          refreshments and games, but we also have funds to provide additional
          activities, such as craft sessions and workshops. We do not intend to
          organise such activities without sufficient input from those who wish
          to attend the sessions.</p>
          <p>We are also looking for any volunteers
          who would be happy to help us run these sessions.</p>

          <p>The young trees in Mersey Bank Park are not flourishing as much as
          they could be. This is partly because there are no edges around the
          trees, so the grass grows right up to the trunk and competes with the
          trees for nutrients. We would like to install some edging for the
          young trees to help them grow. We have discussed this idea with the
          park ranger and are still awaiting a quote for the work. There are 50
          trees in the park that would benefit from having edging installed.</p>
          <p>Costs: Currently unknown</p>

          esatate. There are many people who have lived on the estate for many
          years, some for their whole lives. There is so much history that our
          residents can share and we would like to record that history and make
          it available to all residents through an online archive. The archive
          can be used to store photos, videos and interviews with residents,

          know more people on the estate.</p>

          prizes for the winner and runner up in each category. All winning
          artwork will be posted on the community website, and we will print a
          book containing as many pieces as we can print in an 80 page book. The
          physical book and ebook would be available from lulu.com for residents
          to buy at an expected cost of £5 and £1 respectively. All profits
          would be spent by the group on other community projects.</p>
          <p>Costs: Approximately £200 for prizes, however we would also look for some
          sponsorship.</p>

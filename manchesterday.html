          <h2>What is expected of me?</h2>
          <hr>
          <p>The idea is to get a group of people together, work with a local artist to
decide on an idea we would like to bring to life, and with their help, design
basic costumes and construct a large structure to reflect that idea. Then on the
day, we get together in Deansgate to walk with our structure along the parade
route.
          <p>Involvement can vary according to what you able to do. Ultimately, we need you to turn
  up on the day and walk in the parade, but there are several opportunities to get involved in the
  creative process. You do not need to be able to come to all the sessions, but it
  would be best if you could come to a couple.</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Mid-April</strong> - Brainstorming session, to come up with ideas
  you would like to portray. We work with a local artist to think about what the
  concept we would like to portra,y based on this years theme, and the creative ways we can reflect it.</li>
            <li><strong>End April</strong> - Finalise the idea</li>
            <li><strong>May-early June</strong> - Making sessions. We work with a local artist to bring the
          idea to life. The number of making sessions depends on the complexity of the
          design, but for not all volunteers will be required for all sessions.</li>
            <li><strong>Weekend 2nd June</strong> - Workshop weekend. Either a morning or an aftenroon
          session at a warehouse near the site in Deansgate to put everything together
          ready for the day.</li>
            <li><strong>Weekend 9th June</strong> - Briefing before the big day.</li>

          <h2>What is this years theme?</h2>
          <hr>
          <p>The theme this year is <strong>Word on the street</strong>. This is meant to
    be loosely interpreted and can be used simply to reflect what Manchester, and
    your area in particular, means to you. The idea is to think of something
    positive you would like to say and reflect this creatively using costume and
    large constructions.</p>

          <h2>What is the day like?</h2>
          <hr>
          <p>For those involved in the parade, the schedule of the day looks something like this:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Arrive at Liverpool road. We will be given a start time, and our starting
position will be marked on the road.</li>
            <li>Pick up small items/costumes from the warehouse.</li>
            <li>Large items moved into place by a professional team.</li>
            <li>Parade officially starts at 1 pm. However, depending on our start position
we may not start moving until up to half an hour later.</li>
            <li>Walk the parade route. The route is 1.25 miles and should take about 45
minutes to walk. There will be no shade or cover during the walk and it will go
ahead whatever the weather.</li>
            <li>The parade finishes in Exchange Square at approximately 2:30, though again
the exact finish time will depend on our position in the parade.</li>
          </ol>
          <p>The parade route is available in the official <a href="http://manchesterday.co.uk/download-programme/">programme</a><p>
